# Software
A small selection of software packages is available for all users at all times. If you need software that is not yet installed, please contact Henrik or Even.

## Compilers
A bunch of GNU compilers (gcc/g++, mpicc/mpicxx and gfortran) are installed on all nodes. The default versions are not the most recent (8.4.0/9.4.0) for ease the building of LAMMPS. However, the latest versions (11.1.0) are also installed and can be executed by for instance `gcc-11 --version`.

On the GPU nodes, the cuda compiler can be reached in the usual way, `nvcc --version`. The current version is 10.1.243.
