# History
## Before 2020
The computational physics group has a long history with installing and maintaining computer clusters, starting in 2012 when four racks with CPU nodes were moved the physics department from the TITAN Beowulf cluster. The racks were installed at different locations in the physics building, and the cluster was named Smaug. The old TITAN nodes from 2007 can still be seen behind Store Fysiske Lesesal.

Various computer nodes were bought in the period 2014-2017, including a bunch of CPU nodes named after the Futurama universe (`zoidberg`, `leyla` and `nibbler`) and the Intel Xeon Phi node `kif`. Veronica Berglyd Olsen and Anders Hafreager put lots of effort in installing and running the cluster in this period, among others, but none of the nodes from this period is currently in use.

In 2017, a node containing 8x NVIDIA Tesla P100-PCIE-16GB was bought to utilize the GPU implementations of molecular dynamics software. Since the computer initially was used to simulate faceting of SiC, it was named `bigfacet`. The computer was installed on yet another location in the physics building.

## After 2020
In 2020, the USIT cluster Abel (once among the top 100 powerful supercomputers [1]) was shutdown permanently, and two racks (72 identical CPU-nodes with Intel Xeon E5-2670, 1,152 cores), were brought to the physics department. The nodes were installed in the old Sunmicro racks from TITAN at the same locations as Smaug. Steinn Hauser, Even Nordhagen and Henrik Sveinsson were responsible for the transport and installation. The new cluster was named Egil after the Norwegian physicist Egil Hylleraas, a real pioneer in computational physics.

In 2021, all operating computers were reunioned in the basement garage of physics building. The computers `egil-analyze` and `hugefacet` were purchased to modernize the storage system and add modern GPUs to the cluster. Later the same year, `greatfacet` was bought to increase the number of GPUs further. A new cooling system was installed to cop with the increasing heat production of the cluster.
